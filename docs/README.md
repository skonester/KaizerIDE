## 🔐 Privacy & Security

**Your code stays on your machine. Period.**

KaizerIDE is built with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought. We believe your code, your projects, and your workflow are yours alone.

### What We DON'T Do

- ❌ **No Telemetry** - We don't collect usage data, crash reports, or analytics
- ❌ **No Tracking** - No user tracking, cookies, or third-party services
- ❌ **No Cloud Sync** - Your code never gets uploaded to our servers (we don't have any!)
- ❌ **No Account Required** - Use it completely offline, no sign-up needed
- ❌ **No "Anonymous" Data** - We don't collect anything, period

### What We DO

- ✅ **Local Storage** - All settings, files, and data stay on your device
- ✅ **Open Source** - Audit the code yourself, see exactly what it does
- ✅ **Your API Keys** - Stored locally in your system, never transmitted to us
- ✅ **Direct AI Calls** - AI requests go straight to YOUR chosen endpoint
- ✅ **Offline Capable** - Works without internet (except for AI features)

### AI Privacy

When you use AI features:
- 🔒 Requests go **directly** to your chosen API endpoint (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- 🔒 We **never** see your code, prompts, or responses
- 🔒 Use **local models** (Ollama, LM Studio) for complete offline privacy
- 🔒 **You control** what data leaves your machine

### KaizerIDE vs Other IDEs

| Feature | KaizerIDE | VS Code | Cursor | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Telemetry** | ❌ None | ✅ Yes (opt-out) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Usage Tracking** | ❌ None | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Cloud Sync** | ❌ None | ✅ Optional | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Account Required** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Code Sent to Servers** | ❌ Never | ⚠️ For features | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Local AI Support** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Open Source** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Self-Hosted AI** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ No | ❌ No |

### Why This Matters

- **For Professionals** - Work on sensitive projects without worrying about data leaks
- **For Students** - Learn without being tracked or profiled
- **For Teams** - Keep proprietary code completely private
- **For Everyone** - Your data is yours, not a product to be sold

**Bottom Line:** If privacy matters to you, KaizerIDE is built for you.
