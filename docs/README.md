## 🔐 Privacy & Security

**Your code stays on your machine. Period.**

KaizerIDE is built with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought. We believe your code, your projects, and your workflow are yours alone.

### What We DON'T Do

- ❌ **No Telemetry** - We don't collect usage data, crash reports, or analytics
- ❌ **No Tracking** - No user tracking, cookies, or third-party services
- ❌ **No Cloud Sync** - Your code never gets uploaded to our servers (we don't have any!)
- ❌ **No Account Required** - Use it completely offline, no sign-up needed
- ❌ **No "Anonymous" Data** - We don't collect anything, period

### What We DO

- ✅ **Local Storage** - All settings, files, and data stay on your device
- ✅ **Open Source** - Audit the code yourself, see exactly what it does
- ✅ **Your API Keys** - Stored locally in your system, never transmitted to us
- ✅ **Direct AI Calls** - AI requests go straight to YOUR chosen endpoint
- ✅ **Offline Capable** - Works without internet (except for AI features)

### AI Privacy

When you use AI features:
- 🔒 Requests go **directly** to your chosen API endpoint (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- 🔒 We **never** see your code, prompts, or responses
- 🔒 Use **local models** (Ollama, LM Studio) for complete offline privacy
- 🔒 **You control** what data leaves your machine

### KaizerIDE vs Other IDEs

| Feature | KaizerIDE | VS Code | Cursor | Windsurf |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Telemetry** | ❌ None | ✅ Yes (opt-out) | ✅ Yes (configurable) | ✅ Yes |
| **Usage Tracking** | ❌ None | ✅ Yes (opt-out) | ✅ Yes (privacy mode available) | ✅ Yes |
| **Cloud Sync** | ❌ None | ✅ Optional | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Account Required** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Code Sent to Servers** | ❌ Never* | ⚠️ For some features | ✅ Yes (for AI features) | ✅ Yes (for AI features) |
| **Local AI Support** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited (via Cursor Pro) | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Open Source** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (proprietary) | ❌ No (proprietary) |
| **Self-Hosted AI** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited (via Cursor Pro) | ⚠️ Enterprise only |
| **Bring Your Own API** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited (via Cursor Pro) | ✅ Yes (via Windsurf servers) |

**\*Except when you use AI features - those go to YOUR chosen endpoint**  
**\*\*Cursor routes all requests through their servers, even with custom API keys**

### Why This Matters

**The Key Differences:**

- **KaizerIDE** - Your AI requests go **directly** to your chosen endpoint. Zero telemetry, zero tracking, always.
- **VS Code** - Highly flexible. Can be fully local and private with the right extensions (like Continue + Ollama).
- **Windsurf** - Powerful AI features but routes requests through their servers. Enterprise plans offer self-hosted options.
- **Cursor** - Polished UX but all AI requests go through Cursor's servers, even with your own API key.

**Choose KaizerIDE if:**
- You want **zero telemetry** by default (not opt-out)
- You need **direct API connections** without intermediaries
- You value **simplicity** and **lightweight** design
- You want privacy without enterprise pricing

**Choose VS Code if:**
- You need the **largest extension ecosystem**
- You want **maximum flexibility** and customization
- You're comfortable configuring privacy settings

**Choose Windsurf if:**
- You want **powerful agentic AI** (Cascade)
- You're willing to use their cloud or pay for self-hosted
- You need enterprise features and support

**Choose Cursor if:**
- You want the **most polished AI UX**
- You don't mind cloud dependency
- You're willing to pay for Pro features

**Bottom line:** KaizerIDE is for developers who want **local-first AI coding with no telemetry, no required accounts, and no outbound data by default**.
