## Enterprise-grade trust model

KaizerIDE is suitable for professional environments where security, compliance, and predictability matter.

- **Deterministic data behavior** - No hidden services, background syncing, or opaque data flows.
- **Composable AI architecture** - Integrate with internal LLMs, private endpoints, or local model servers.
- **Infrastructure-independent design** - Runs without vendor lock-in or required cloud dependencies.
- **Audit-friendly model** - Open architecture allows inspection and verification.
- **Deployment flexibility** - Works for individual machines, secured teams, and isolated environments.

KaizerIDE is built for teams that require control over convenience trade-offs.

| **Cloud sync** | None | Optional | Yes | Yes |
| **Account required** | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Code sent to servers** | Never by default* | For some features | Yes, for AI features | Yes, for AI features |
| **Workspace indexing** | Local, no AI needed | Manual search | Semantic AI vector embeddings | RAG-based AI indexing |
| **Local AI support** | Yes | Full | Limited via Cursor Pro | Limited |
| **Open source** | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **Self-hosted AI** | Yes | Yes | Limited via Cursor Pro | Enterprise only |
| **Bring your own API** | Yes | Yes | Limited via Cursor Pro | Yes, via Windsurf servers |

\* AI features send selected prompt/context data to the endpoint you configure.

## Key differences

- **KaizerIDE** - AI requests go directly to your chosen endpoint. Workspace indexing is local, fast, private, and works offline without AI or cloud embeddings.
- **VS Code** - Highly flexible and extensible. Can be configured for local and private workflows with the right extensions.
- **Windsurf** - Powerful agentic AI with cloud-based or enterprise AI workflows and AI-driven repository context.
- **Cursor** - Polished AI UX with semantic indexing and multi-file reasoning, with cloud dependency for core AI features.

## Choose KaizerIDE if

- You want **zero telemetry by default**.
- You need **direct API connections** without intermediaries.
- You value **simple and lightweight** tooling.
- You need **local workspace indexing** that works offline without AI.
- You want privacy without enterprise pricing.
